### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation

I analysed Airbnb listings data obtained from the Inside Airbnb site to understand:
1. How does London listings compare with other European cities?
2. How does London listing prices change from now till end of year?
3. What is the distribution of listings in London?
4. Which borough has the best reviews?
5. How much can you expect to save by living in Outer London vs Inner London?

### File Descriptions
The Jupyter notebook contains the codes used for this exploratory analysis. 
The data folder contains the files downloaded from the Inside Airbnb site. 
The assets folder contains the charts from the Jupyter Notebook. 


### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bryanchen21/londons-airbnb-market-explained-visually-2b9bb4d746aa).
